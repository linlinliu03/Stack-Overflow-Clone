Usually, this notification will be an error or info of some sort. I need to then dispatch another action after 5 seconds that will return the notification state to initial one, so no notification. The main reason behind this is to provide functionality where notifications disappear automatically after 5 seconds.

There is no store here, yes there are some examples without using store. I went through several tutorials, it seems everyone has their own style of implementation.
